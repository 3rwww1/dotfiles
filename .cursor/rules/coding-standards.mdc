# Coding Standards

## Code Editing Practices

- Implement changes directly via edits; don't paste large diffs in chat
- Keep edits scoped and readable; match existing style and formatting
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same edit

## Communication Style

- Prefer concise, high-signal replies with minimal fluff
- Use headings and bullet points; avoid walls of text
- Format filenames/paths/functions/classes with backticks
