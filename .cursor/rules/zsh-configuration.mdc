# Zsh Configuration Standards

## Keybindings and Configuration

- Use `bindkey -e` and native keybindings unless explicitly overridden
- Configure completions via `fpath` and `compinit`; avoid insecure dirs
- Load Homebrew plugins conditionally; keep `~/.zfunc` and `~/.zsh/completions` tidy

## Completions Management

- install-completions.sh must be idempotent and OS-agnostic
- Link into ~/.zfunc and never write to system completion directories
