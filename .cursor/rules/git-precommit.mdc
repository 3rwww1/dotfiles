# Git and Pre-commit Standards

## Git Hygiene

- Avoid committing secrets; enforce gitleaks
- Favor small, purposeful commits with clear messages focusing on why
- Do not create branches or push without explicit user request
- Before resolving merge conflicts, review and understand all commits not on `main`

## Pre-commit Hooks

- Keep hooks fast and non-flaky; scope shellcheck to sh files, validate zsh with `zsh -n`
- For Vale, prefer project-local config and allow fallback to user config
