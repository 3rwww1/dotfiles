# Project Structure Standards

## Phase Organization

- No global code in sourced files; each phase exposes a function named after the file (e.g., `bootstrap`, `package_sync`, `self_test`) under `scripts/phases`
- `install.sh` sources all phase modules at the top, then calls their functions in sequence
- OS-specific bootstrap helpers are sourced by the `bootstrap` phase under `scripts/phases/bootstrap/`

## Indentation Management

- Use a single indent variable in `install.sh`; pass it to phase functions
- IND maps to spaces via `indent_str` with indent size 2

## File Organization

- Include: scripts/**/*.sh, scripts/**, **/*.sh, install.sh, zsh/**, direnv/**, packages/**, brew/**
- Exclude: **/.git/**, **/node_modules/**, **/.terraform/**, **/vendor/**, **/build/**, **/dist/**, **/.cache/**
