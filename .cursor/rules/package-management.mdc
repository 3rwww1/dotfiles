# Package Management Standards

## Single Source of Truth

- Single source of truth under packages/
- macOS present via packages/macos/Brewfile; Linux present via plaintext lists
- Common overlays in packages/common/{present,absent}.txt
- Apply policy in phase 03 only (no installs in bootstraps)

## Platform-Specific Rules

- macOS: use Homebrew; Linux: apt; avoid privileged ops in CI
- Test install.sh on both macOS and Debian containers
